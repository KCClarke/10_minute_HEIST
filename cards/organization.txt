Cards shall be organized in fhe following way:
    
    1. All light cards precede dark cards.

    2. Then, by special set,
    cards go from crescent to full to no moon. 

    3. Cards are then in order by suit from
    potion to fossil to artifact to jewel to tome to wild.
    If a card has no suit it goes after wild.

    4. Then cards are placed from low to high by value.
    The value on "Sands of Illusion" is a '*' and for the sake
    of sorting we use its ascii value, the number 42.
    Cards with multiple values will be placed after cards with 
    single values.
    
    "Tales of Myth & Magic" comes before "Sands of Illusion".
    "Haunted Nesting Dolls" is the last card of the full moon set.

    5. Finally cards are sorted alphabetically by name.

    "Love Potion #8" is the first card.
    "Necronomicon" is the last card.
